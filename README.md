# CMPS 2200  Recitation 01

**Name (Team Member 1):**_____Noelle Fox_____  
**Name (Team Member 2):**____Mohini Yadav_______

In this recitation, we will investigate asymptotic complexity. Additionally, we will get familiar with the various technologies we'll use for collaborative coding.

To complete this recitation, follow the instructions in this document. Some of your answers will go in this file, and others will require you to edit `main.py`. All tests are in `test_main.py`.

## Install Python Dependency

We need Python library of "tabulate" to visualize the results in a good shape. Please install it by running 'pip install tabulate' or 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in Shell Tab of Repl.  

## Running and testing your code

- To run tests, from the command-line shell, you can run
  + `pytest test_main.py` will run all tests
  + `pytest test_main.py::test_one` will just run `test_one`
  + We recommend running one test at a time as you are debugging.

## Turning in your work

- Once complete, click on the "Git" icon in the left pane on repl.it.
- Enter a commit message in the "what did you change?" text box
- Click "commit and push." This will push your code to your github repository.
- Although you are working as a team, please have each team member submit the same code to their repository. One person can copy the code to their repl.it and submit it from there.

## Comparing search algorithms

We'll compare the running times of `linear_search` and `binary_search` empirically.

`Binary Search`: Search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Begin with an interval covering the whole array. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.

- [ ] 1. In `main.py`, the implementation of `linear_search` is already complete. Your task is to implement `binary_search`. Implement a recursive solution using the helper function `_binary_search`. 

- [ ] 2. Test that your function is correct by calling from the command-line `pytest test_main.py::test_binary_search`

- [ ] 3. Write at least two additional test cases in `test_binary_search` and confirm they pass.

- [ ] 4. Describe the worst case input value of `key` for `linear_search`? for `binary_search`? 

**TODO: your answer goes here** The worst case input value of `key` for both `linear_search` and `binary_search` is if the value is not present in the list at all. For `linear_search` each element in the array will have to be itterated through and for `binary_search` the function will be repeatedly divided the maximum amount of times, thus making both of these the most time consuming. 

- [ ] 5. Describe the best case input value of `key` for `linear_search`? for `binary_search`? 

**TODO: your answer goes here** The base case input value of `key` for `linear_search` is when it is the very first value in the list. For example if you have the list [1,2,3,4,5] the best value would be 1 because it is in the first space checked. For `binary_search` the best key would be the value directly in the middle. Using the same list, the best value for `binary_search` would be 3 because it is in the middle space and is checked first.

- [ ] 6. Complete the `time_search` function to compute the running time of a search function. Note that this is an example of a "higher order" function, since one of its parameters is another function.

- [ ] 7. Complete the `compare_search` function to compare the running times of linear search and binary search. Confirm the implementation by running `pytest test_main.py::test_compare_search`, which contains some simple checks.

- [ ] 8. Call `print_results(compare_search())` and paste the results here:

**TODO: add your timing results here**
|            n |   linear |   binary |
|--------------|----------|----------|
|       10.000 |    0.007 |    0.008 |
|      100.000 |    0.005 |    0.002 |
|     1000.000 |    0.038 |    0.002 |
|    10000.000 |    0.529 |    0.004 |
|   100000.000 |    5.514 |    0.005 |
|  1000000.000 |   48.178 |    0.012 |
| 10000000.000 |  481.518 |    0.018 |

- [ ] 9. The theoretical worst-case running time of linear search is $O(n)$ and binary search is $O(log_2(n))$. Do these theoretical running times match your empirical results? Why or why not?

**TODO: your answer goes here** Yes because a linear search runs through each element individually to assert if the key is in the list or not which is represented in the worst-case run time O(n) which runs through n elements, therefore the run-time is increasing linearly. It also matches for the binary search because as the code runs through the binary search it divides by 2 each iteration which is represented by log_2(n), therefore the binary search run-time is increasing logarithmically.   

- [ ] 10. Binary search assumes the input list is already sorted. Assume it takes $\Theta(n^2)$ time to sort a list of length $n$. Suppose you know ahead of time that you will search the same list $k$ times. 
  + What is worst-case complexity of searching a list of $n$ elements $k$ times using linear search? **TODO: your answer goes here** worst-case complexity of searching using linear search: O(k*n)
  + For binary search? **TODO: your answer goes here** binary search worst-case complexity: O(n^2+k*logn)
  + For what values of $k$ is it more efficient to first sort and then use binary search versus just using linear search without sorting? **TODO: your answer goes here** For smaller k values, linear search is more efficient. As k increases sorting first then using binary is more efficient because the time to perforom k binary searches becomes less significant than iterating through each element as in a linear search.
